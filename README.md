# Nathan Pruzaniec's Resume

##Build
This project is built with HAML and SASS. To make changes use:
`gem install haml`
`gem install sass`

Then you can build the HTML from the HAML file, and watch the SCSS file for changes to build the CSS.

`haml index.haml index.html`
`sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css`

###Hope you enjoy!
